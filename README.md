# pystrap (a.k.a. bootstrappy)

**Bootstrap any Python tool from GitHub in a single command.**  
Clone, install, and launch it globally â€” without the virtualenv headaches.

---

## ðŸ”§ What it Does

`pystrap` is a shell script that turns any Python-based GitHub project into a globally accessible CLI tool. It:

- Clones the repo to `/opt/<toolname>`
- Creates a Python virtual environment in that directory
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `REQUIREMENTS`
- Finds the most likely main script
- Writes a launcher to `/usr/local/bin/<toolname>` that activates the venv and runs the tool

No symlinks, no aliases, no manual setup. Just run the tool by name.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Install

Install `pystrap` directly from this repo:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjt263/pystrap/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## âš¡ Usage

```bash
pystrap <github-url> [custom-name]
```

### Example:

```bash
pystrap https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng.git
```

This will install `recon-ng`, and youâ€™ll be able to run it from anywhere:

```bash
recon-ng
```

Or install it under a custom name:

```bash
pystrap https://github.com/you/some-cool-tool.git mytool
mytool
```

## ðŸ“‚ How it Works

Behind the scenes, `pystrap`:

1. Extracts the repo name from the URL
2. Clones it to `/opt/<reponame>`
3. Creates a Python virtual environment inside
4. Installs dependencies automatically
5. Detects a likely main script
6. Creates a launcher at `/usr/local/bin/<name>` that runs it in the right environment

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Bash
- Python 3
- pip
- git
- curl

Tested on Debian/Ubuntu. Works on most Unix-like systems.

---

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy

Scripting shouldnâ€™t derail your momentum.  
You shouldnâ€™t have to babysit venvs, symlink scripts, or manually wire up boilerplate just to try a tool.

This is the one-liner we always wanted.

## ðŸ§ª Future Plans

- Auto-update support
- Uninstall command
- Local path support
- Domain-based install URL (`pystrap.sh` or similar)

## ðŸ”“ License

MIT â€” do what you want, just donâ€™t be evil.
